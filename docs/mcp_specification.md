# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Specification

## Overview
MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. It follows a client-server architecture and enables flexible integration with data sources and tools.

## Core Concepts
### Architecture
- **MCP Hosts**: Applications like Claude Desktop or IDEs that use MCP
- **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that connect to MCP servers
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs exposing capabilities through MCP
- **Local Data Sources**: Files, databases, and services accessible by MCP servers
- **Remote Services**: External systems (e.g., APIs) connected via MCP
- **XX Shell Integration**: Native support for XX Shell Mode commands and plugins

### Resources
- Expose data and content from servers to LLMs
- Defined using the `@Resource` decorator in the Python SDK
- Integrated with xx_shell command system

### Prompts
- Reusable prompt templates and workflows
- Enable consistent interactions with LLMs
- Integrated with xx_shell session management

### Tools
- Allow LLMs to perform actions through servers
- Examples: API calls, database queries, file operations
- Integrated with xx_shell plugin system

### Sampling
- Servers can request completions from LLMs
- Supports dynamic context generation
- Integrated with xx_shell command execution

### Transports
- Communication mechanism between clients and servers
- Supports HTTP, WebSocket, and other protocols
- Integrated with xx_shell networking stack

### AI-Assisted Development
MCP servers and clients can be developed using AI pair programming tools like Aider. This enables:
- Rapid prototyping of MCP resources
- AI-assisted debugging and testing
- Automated documentation updates
- Efficient refactoring of MCP implementations
- Seamless integration with xx_shell development tools
