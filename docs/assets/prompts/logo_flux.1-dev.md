**Visual Concept**:
- Two bold **"X"** characters styled as sleek, modern shapes (possibly with a gradient or metallic finish) placed side by side to form **XX**.
- Below or beside the **XX**, incorporate a stylized shell shape (e.g., a conch shell, a command prompt symbol like `>_`, or a terminal window outline) to reference the shell environment.
- The **XX** can be futuristic and tech-forward, using geometric fonts or slightly tilted to suggest motion and modernity.
