# Testing Strategy for XX Shell

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for XX Shell, an intelligent command shell with AI capabilities. The strategy combines automated and manual testing approaches to ensure high quality and reliability.

## Test Levels

### Unit Testing
- **Scope**: Individual components and classes
- **Tools**: pytest
- **Coverage**: Core functionality (shell, session management, plugins)
- **Location**: `tests/unit/`

### Integration Testing  
- **Scope**: Interaction between components
- **Tools**: pytest with fixtures
- **Coverage**: Plugin integration, session persistence, command execution
- **Location**: `tests/integration/`

### System Testing
- **Scope**: End-to-end functionality
- **Tools**: pytest with subprocess
- **Coverage**: CLI behavior, error handling, user workflows
- **Location**: `tests/system/`

### Acceptance Testing
- **Scope**: User acceptance criteria
- **Tools**: Manual testing, user scenarios
- **Coverage**: Key user journeys, usability
- **Location**: Manual test cases

## Test Types

### Functional Testing
